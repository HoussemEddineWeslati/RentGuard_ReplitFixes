# Overview

This is a comprehensive GLI (Gestion des Loyers ImpayÃ©s) web application designed to help landlords protect their rental income through automated rent tracking and insurance premium calculations. The application provides landlords with tools to manage properties and tenants, track payment statuses, calculate insurance premiums, and subscribe to different service plans.

The system operates as a SaaS platform with multiple subscription tiers (Free, Pro, Enterprise) and includes features for property management, tenant tracking, automated rent monitoring, and GLI insurance quote generation.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **React with TypeScript**: Modern React application using functional components and hooks
- **Wouter**: Lightweight client-side routing solution for navigation between pages
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management for API calls, caching, and synchronization
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: Form handling with schema validation for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui**: Utility-first styling with pre-built component library
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server for fast development experience

## Backend Architecture
- **Express.js with TypeScript**: RESTful API server with type safety
- **Session-based Authentication**: Express sessions with bcrypt password hashing
- **Memory Storage**: In-memory data storage for development/demo purposes
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database ORM configured for PostgreSQL (ready for production)
- **Modular Route Structure**: Organized API endpoints for auth, properties, tenants, quotes, and subscriptions

## Data Layer Design
- **Shared Schema**: Common TypeScript types and Zod schemas between frontend and backend
- **Relational Data Model**: Users -> Properties -> Tenants with proper foreign key relationships
- **Quote System**: Standalone quote calculations with user association
- **Subscription Management**: Plan-based access control with different feature tiers

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Session-based Auth**: Server-side sessions with secure cookie handling
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-based authentication checking for protected endpoints
- **Client-side Auth State**: React Query-powered authentication state management
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing for secure password storage
